            <p>Dear Kashan,
            <br><br>
            First off, I'm gonna miss u alottttðŸ˜­. I know you gonna say something like "Nathan you don't have to do all of this, I'm only gonna be gone a month" and to that I say shut up and let me talkðŸ˜‚. Ever since I met you, you've made me happier than I ever been. Every moment with you I really enjoy and I'mm really glad I know you. I don't want this sound like a goodbye message so I'm going to keep it short loll. But I know we'll still talk everyday but I'm really gonna miss you alot. You're the reason I run to both of my phones every morning lol, the reason I sacrifice sleep lmao, and you just really mean alot to me. I'm hoping that when you travel you'll be safe and that you enjoy your time. You're in canada so that means you're in the weeknd's home and that's a privilegeðŸ¤§. But in all honesty I really hope you have fun and I hope I can hear from you everyday, I'm really gonna miss seeing you in real life for a whole month but I can't wait until you get back. In conclusion, this is just smth I wrote for you because imma miss you alot and I'm not gonna be seeing you monday or tuesday sadlyðŸ˜­ but travel safely and have fun kayy.
            <br><br>
            Love,
            Nathan :) .</p>
